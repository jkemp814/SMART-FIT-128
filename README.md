# Portable Development Environment

A cross-platform portable development environment supporting both **Linux and Windows**. This setup provides reproducible development environments with portable applications, dev containers, and organized development tools—all self-contained and runnable from external drives.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Runs on Linux and Windows from portable storage
- **Portable Applications**: PortableFirefox, PortableChromium, KeePass, Calibre, and more included
- **Development Environments**: Pre-configured setups for Python, Rust, C++, Bash, and full development stacks
- **Portable Git**: Self-contained Git installation
- **Portable VS Code**: Linux and Windows versions included
- **Dev Containers**: Docker/container support for isolated development
- **Projects Folder**: Centralized workspace for your code repositories

## Prerequisites

- **For Dev Containers**: Podman or Docker must be installed on the host machine
  - **Linux**: Install Podman or Docker via your package manager
  - **Windows**: Install Docker Desktop (includes Docker Engine)
  - **macOS**: Install Docker Desktop or Podman

## Getting Started

### Using on Linux

1. Open the workspace file in VS Code:
   ```bash
   code PORTABLE-DEV.code-workspace
   ```
2. Use the environment-specific setups in `Environments/`
3. Add your projects to the `Projects/` folder
4. Use Portable Git located in `PortableGit/bin/git`

### Using on Windows

1. Open the workspace file in VS Code Portable (Windows):
   ```bash
   VSCodePortable-Windows/bin/Code.exe PORTABLE-DEV.code-workspace
   ```
2. Use Portable Git for version control
3. Add your projects to the `Projects/` folder

### Working with Dev Containers

1. Configure your environment in `Environments/`
2. Set up `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` with proper mounts
3. Use "Reopen in Container" in VS Code when ready

## Customization

- **Development Environments**: Each subfolder in `Environments/` contains environment-specific configurations
- **Dev Container Setup**: Edit or create `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` in your environment to customize container mounts and tools
- **Portable Apps**: Install additional portable applications in the `PortableApps/` folder
- **Scripts**: Add helper scripts to `Toolchest/` for common tasks

## Tips

- **Mount External Drives**: Use `devcontainer.json` mounts to access Projects folder from inside containers
- **Portability**: Keep all development tools and data on the external drive for use across computers
- **Version Control**: Each project in `Projects/` can be its own git repository
- **Cross-Platform Switching**: Use the same codebase on both Linux and Windows without duplication
- **Browser Option**: Side note: you can use either PortableFirefox or PortableChromium
- **Keep It Clean**: Use `.gitignore` to exclude build artifacts and temporary files
