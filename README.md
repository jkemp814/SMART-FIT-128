## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FEDORA_DEV.git
   cd FEDORA_DEV
   ```
2. Open in VS Code and "Reopen in Container" when prompted.
3. Add your projects to the `projects/` folder.
4. Use provided scripts and configs as needed.

## Customization

- Edit `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` to add or remove tools.
- Place reusable configs in `.devcontainer/configs/`.
- Add your own scripts to `.devcontainer/scripts/`.

## Tips

- Each project in `projects/` can be its own git repo.
