## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- **Linux:** Podman (recommended) or Docker installed on the host
- **Windows:** Docker Desktop or [Podman for Windows](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation)
- **macOS:** Docker Desktop or Podman (some features may require adaptation)
- **External or Portable Storage:** For maximum portability

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### On Linux

```bash
./VSCodePortable-Linux/bin/code PORTABLE-DEV.code-workspace
```

- Use the provided configs in `Environments/`
- Keep your repositories in `Projects/`
- VS Code and Git = portable, ready-to-go

### On Windows

```powershell
VSCodePortable-Windows/bin/Code.exe PORTABLE-DEV.code-workspace
```

- Use `PortableGit` for version control
- Your projects and tools are all set up under one roof

### Dev Containers (Optional, recommended for isolation)

1. Configure environments in `Environments/`
2. Use or edit `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`
3. In VS Code, "Reopen in Container"

---

## ⚙️ Customization

- **Environments:** Tweak configs per language/stack in `Environments/`
- **Dev Containers:** Update `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` as needed
- **Portable Apps:** Add more apps to `PortableApps/`
- **Scripts:** Your helper scripts go in `Toolchest/`

## 💡 Tips

- **Portability:** Run everything off a USB SSD, NVMe, or portable drive for true plug-and-code freedom.
- **Mount Drives:** With dev containers, use mounts for `Projects/` as your codespace.
- **Version Control:** Each project in `Projects/` can be its own Git repo, managed with PortableGit.
- **Cross-Platform:** Use the same workspace and codebase on both Windows & Linux without duplication.
- **Keep It Clean:** Use `.gitignore` wisely for build artifacts and temp files.
